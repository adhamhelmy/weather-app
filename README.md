# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
This is a simple webpage, i set up my server then got credentials from openweathermap and tk the data ii needed from there, took input from the user and changed the UI according to the data recieved.
